# Getting Started with [Your Project Name]

This document outlines the steps to set up and run the project locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js and npm (or yarn):**  You can download and install Node.js (which includes npm) from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).  If you prefer yarn, you can install it after installing Node.js by running `npm install -g yarn`.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crombout89/2800-202510-DTC04.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd hello-world-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install  // Or yarn install if using yarn
   ```

## Running the Project

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start  // Or yarn start if using yarn
   ```

   This will start the development server and open your application in a web browser.  Any changes you make to the code will automatically be reflected in the browser.

## Building for Production

To create a production build of your application:

```bash
npm run build  // Or yarn build if using yarn
```

This will create an optimized build of your application in the `build` directory.

## Available Scripts (npm)

Here are the available scripts defined in the `package.json`:

* `npm start`: Starts the development server.
* `npm run build`: Creates a production build.
* `npm test`: Runs the test suite (if applicable).  (You'll need to configure testing if you haven't already.)
* [Add any other custom scripts here]

## Project Structure

* `public/`: Contains static assets like `index.html`.
* `src/`: Contains the source code of your React application.
* `node_modules/`: Contains the project's dependencies.
* `package.json`:  The project's configuration file.
* `.gitignore`: Specifies files and folders to be ignored by Git.
* `README.md`:  This file.
* [Add any other important folders/files here]

## Contributing

[Describe the process for contributing to the project, if applicable.]

## Troubleshooting

* **`npm ERR! Missing script: "start"`:** Make sure you're in the correct project directory and that the `"start"` script is defined in your `package.json`.
* **`sh: react-scripts: command not found`:** Make sure `react-scripts` is installed (`npm install react-scripts`).
